## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(caret)
library(caTools)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)



```
## Import the Data

First step is to get the data into our R environment.

```{r}
trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"

testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

```


## Data Cleaning

remove the first column - it's just an index.

```{r}

training<-training[,-1]
testing<-testing[,-1]

```




There are 159 variables and several of them provide little predictive value. We can remove them like this:

```{r}
training<-training[, apply(training, 2, function(x) !any(is.na(x)))] 
testing<-testing[, apply(testing, 2, function(x) !any(is.na(x)))] 


```

Now we are down to just 59 variables.

## Partition the dataset into two.


```{r}
spl<-sample.split(training$classe, SplitRatio = 0.70)

train<-subset(training, spl==TRUE)
test<-subset(training, spl==FALSE)

```

## Decision Tree Model

Let's create a decision tree to predict "classe" using the train data set.



```{r}
modrpart<-rpart(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "class")


```

## View the model

```{r}
prp(modrpart)


```

## Predict using the "test" data set.

```{r}
predrpart<-predict(modrpart, newdata = test, type = "class")


```

## Compare predicted with actual values for "classe"


```{r}
confusionMatrix(predrpart, test$classe)


```
